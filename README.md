# MultiInstruct Reproducibility

This repository contains the code for reproducing the experiments from the paper "MultiInstruct: Improving Multi-Modal Zero-Shot Learning via Instruction Tuning" by Zhiyang Xu, Ying Shen, and Lifu Huang.

## Project Structure

- `download_data.sh`: Script to download the required datasets.
- `process_data.sh`: Script to preprocess the datasets.
- `build_dataset.py`: Python script to build the final dataset.
- `train_model.py`: Python script to fine-tune the model on the MultiInstruct dataset.
- `requirements.txt`: List of dependencies required to run the code.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/MultiInstruct-Reproducibility.git
    cd MultiInstruct-Reproducibility
    ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Download and Preprocess Data**:
    ```bash
    sh download_data.sh
    sh process_data.sh
    python build_dataset.py
    ```

4. **Fine-Tune the Model**:
    ```bash
    python train_model.py
    ```

## Running the Experiments

Follow the steps above to set up the environment and run the experiments. Ensure you have access to the necessary computational resources (e.g., GPU) to fine-tune the model efficiently.

## Results

Include a table comparing your results to the published results, and discuss any discrepancies observed.
